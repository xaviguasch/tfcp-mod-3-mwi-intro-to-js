//Assignment - Functions Exercise

// Functions are important building blocks in any language. They help ensure that your code follows the DRY principle and that you follow a design principle called Separation of Concerns. Your functions should “do one thing and do it well” (McIlroy). These exercises will help strengthen your function know-how.

// Write a function that accepts two numbers as parameters, and returns the sum.

// Write a function that accepts three numbers as parameters, and returns the largest of those numbers.

// Write a function that accepts one number as a parameter, and returns whether that number is even or odd. (Return the string "even" or "odd");
