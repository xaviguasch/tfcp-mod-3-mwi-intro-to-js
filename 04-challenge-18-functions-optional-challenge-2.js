//Assignment - Functions Optional Challenge 2

// Write a function that accepts a number ‘n’ as a parameter. Then print the first ‘n’ Fibonacci numbers and return their sum.
// The first numbers are:

// 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144
// So if n were 6, the sum of 1+1+2+3+5+8 would be 20
// Don't hardcode the sequence.
