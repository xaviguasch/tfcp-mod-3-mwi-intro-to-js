//Assignment - Functions Optional Challenge 1

// Write a function that accepts a string as a parameter. If the length of the string is less than or equal to twenty characters long, return the string concatenated with itself (string + string). If the string is more than twenty characters long, return the first half of the string. You will need to use a string method or two:
// -slice()
// -concat() (optional)
